## Project Memory

# Project Memory

This file contains persistent project context and learned information that should be preserved across Claude Code sessions.

## Project Overview

**Project Path:** D:\Projects\Dev\Memory
**Memory System:** Prsist Memory System v1.0
**Created:** 2025-01-17

This project implements the Prsist System framework with an integrated Prsist Memory System for enhanced AI-powered development workflows.

## Key Decisions and Patterns

### Architecture Decisions

- **Hybrid Storage Strategy**: Combination of JSON files for session data and SQLite database for efficient querying and relationships
- **Hook-Based Integration**: Non-invasive integration with Claude Code using hooks that fail gracefully
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for database, session tracking, context building, and memory management
- **Security-First Approach**: Input sanitization, path validation, and parameterized queries throughout

### Development Patterns

- **Dependency Resolution System**: BMAD agents only load required resources to keep context lean
- **Template-Based Documentation**: YAML-structured templates for consistent document generation
- **Automated Release Strategy**: Dual publishing with beta and stable channels

## Important Context

### Prsist System Framework
- Uses specialized AI agents for different development roles (architect, developer, QA, etc.)
- Implements sophisticated dependency system for context management
- Templates defined in YAML format with structured sections
- Build system creates concatenated text bundles from agent definitions

### Memory System Integration
- Phase 1 focuses on core session tracking with hooks, session files, SQLite storage, and basic context injection
- Designed to be compatible with existing BMAD workflows
- Must not interfere with Claude Code performance (hooks complete within 2 seconds)
- Implements automatic cleanup and retention policies

### Configuration Management
- Central configuration in `bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- Memory system configuration in `.prsist/config/memory-config.yaml`
- Markdown linting rules enforced via Prettier
- Version management for core and expansion packs

## Development Notes

### Performance Requirements
- Hook execution must complete within 2 seconds
- Memory usage should be minimal (< 50MB)
- Database operations should be atomic
- File I/O should be non-blocking where possible

### Security Considerations
- All file paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- Inputs sanitized before database insertion
- Parameterized SQL queries used throughout
- Appropriate file permissions set on memory system files

### Testing Strategy
- Session creation and tracking validation
- SQLite database operations verification
- Context injection functionality testing
- Hook execution timing validation
- Error handling and edge case testing

## Architecture Notes

### Memory System Components

1. **Database Layer** (`database.py`): SQLite operations for persistent storage
2. **Session Tracker** (`session_tracker.py`): Session lifecycle management
3. **Context Builder** (`context_builder.py`): Context injection and relevance scoring
4. **Memory Manager** (`memory_manager.py`): Main interface for memory operations
5. **Utilities** (`utils.py`): Common helpers and validation functions

### Integration Points

- **Claude Code Hooks**: `SessionStart.py` and `PostToolUse.py` in `.claude/hooks/`
- **Configuration Files**: YAML configuration and JSON schema validation
- **Storage Structure**: Organized directory structure under `.prsist/`
- **BMAD Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with existing BMAD workflows

### Data Flow

1. Session starts → Hook initializes memory system → Context loaded for Claude
2. Tool usage → Hook logs interaction → Database updated → Session file updated
3. File modifications → Tracked and hashed → Line changes calculated
4. Periodic checkpoints → Session state preserved → Cleanup based on retention policy

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

- Semantic similarity scoring for context relevance
- Advanced context scoring algorithms
- Intelligent summarization of session data
- Cross-session learning and pattern recognition
- Integration with BMAD agent memory sharing
- Enhanced workflow integration capabilities
