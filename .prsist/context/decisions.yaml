decisions:
  - title: "Hybrid Storage Architecture"
    description: "Decided to use combination of JSON files for session data and SQLite database for efficient querying. This provides both human-readable session files and performant database operations."
    category: "architecture"
    impact: "high"
    date: "2025-01-17T00:00:00Z"
    timestamp: 1737072000
    rationale: "JSON files are easy to debug and backup, while SQLite provides efficient querying for analytics and context building."

  - title: "Hook-Based Integration Strategy"
    description: "Chose to integrate with Claude Code using hooks rather than core modifications. This ensures the memory system fails gracefully and doesn't impact Claude Code performance."
    category: "integration"
    impact: "high"
    date: "2025-01-17T00:00:00Z"
    timestamp: 1737072000
    rationale: "Non-invasive approach allows memory system to be optional and maintains compatibility with Claude Code updates."

  - title: "Modular Python Architecture"
    description: "Separated memory system into distinct modules: database, session_tracker, context_builder, memory_manager, and utils. Each module has a single responsibility."
    category: "architecture"
    impact: "medium"
    date: "2025-01-17T00:00:00Z"
    timestamp: 1737072000
    rationale: "Modular design improves maintainability, testability, and allows for easier future enhancements."

  - title: "Security-First Implementation"
    description: "Implemented comprehensive security measures including path validation, input sanitization, and parameterized SQL queries throughout the system."
    category: "security"
    impact: "high"
    date: "2025-01-17T00:00:00Z"
    timestamp: 1737072000
    rationale: "Security is critical when handling file operations and database interactions in a development environment."

  - title: "Performance Constraints"
    description: "Set strict performance requirements: hooks must complete within 2 seconds, memory usage under 50MB, atomic database operations."
    category: "performance"
    impact: "medium"
    date: "2025-01-17T00:00:00Z"
    timestamp: 1737072000
    rationale: "Memory system must not impact Claude Code's responsiveness or user experience."

  - title: "YAML Configuration Management"
    description: "Used YAML for configuration files to maintain consistency with Prsist System framework and improve human readability."
    category: "configuration"
    impact: "low"
    date: "2025-01-17T00:00:00Z"
    timestamp: 1737072000
    rationale: "YAML is already used throughout the BMAD ecosystem and provides better readability than JSON for configuration."

  - title: "Graceful Degradation Design"
    description: "Designed all components to fail gracefully when memory system is unavailable or encounters errors, ensuring Claude Code continues to function normally."
    category: "reliability"
    impact: "high"
    date: "2025-01-17T00:00:00Z"
    timestamp: 1737072000
    rationale: "Memory system should enhance the development experience, not hinder it when things go wrong."
