# Prsist Memory System - Phases 2-4 Implementation Prompt

## Context

You are implementing advanced phases of the Prsist Memory System. Phase 1 (basic session tracking, hooks, SQLite storage) is complete and working. Now you need to implement the next phases to add intelligence, optimization, and enterprise features.

## What You Have

-  **Phase 1 Complete**: Basic memory system with session tracking, Claude Code hooks, SQLite database, context injection, CLI interface
-  **Solid Foundation**: Proven architecture with security, performance, and reliability
-  **Active System**: Currently tracking sessions and building context successfully

## What to Implement

### Phase 2: Git Integration & Advanced Context
**Priority: High** - Extends current system with Git awareness and productivity tracking

Key Components:
- `git_integration.py` - Link sessions to git commits, branch context
- Enhanced `context_builder.py` - Predictive context loading
- `productivity_tracker.py` - Measure development velocity with memory
- Database extensions for git commits, code changes, productivity metrics

### Phase 3: Semantic Understanding & AI
**Priority: Medium** - Adds intelligence and semantic understanding

Key Components:
- `semantic_analyzer.py` - Code semantic analysis, similarity scoring
- Enhanced `knowledge_manager.py` - Cross-session learning, knowledge graphs
- `ai_context_manager.py` - Intelligent context compression and prediction
- Advanced analytics and pattern recognition

### Phase 4: Optimization & Enterprise
**Priority: Lower** - Performance optimization and enterprise features

Key Components:
- `kv_cache_manager.py` - Intelligent caching for performance
- `portable_sync_manager.py` - Cross-machine synchronization
- `analytics_engine.py` - Advanced insights and predictions
- `enterprise_manager.py` - Multi-project, RBAC, audit logging

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start with Phase 2** - Most immediately valuable, builds on current success
2. **Implement incrementally** - Add features one at a time, test thoroughly
3. **Maintain backward compatibility** - Don't break existing Phase 1 functionality
4. **Focus on value** - Prioritize features that provide immediate development benefits

### Phase 2 Quick Wins
- Git commit linking (immediate value for understanding context)
- Branch context management (helps with feature branch workflows)
- Basic productivity tracking (quantify memory system benefits)

### Development Guidelines
- Follow existing code patterns and security practices
- Use configuration-driven feature flags
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add thorough testing for new features
- Update CLI interface for new capabilities

## Files Available

- `phase-2-implementation.md` - Detailed Phase 2 specifications
- `phase-3-implementation.md` - Detailed Phase 3 specifications  
- `phase-4-implementation.md` - Detailed Phase 4 specifications
- `memory-config-v2.yaml` - Phase 2 configuration template
- `memory-config-v3.yaml` - Phase 3 configuration template
- `optimization-config.yaml` - Phase 4 configuration template

## Current System Status

The Phase 1 system is production-ready with:
- Session tracking working perfectly
- Claude Code hooks integrated and stable
- SQLite database with clean schema
- Context injection providing value
- CLI interface with 28 commands
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Clean documentation

## Next Steps

1. Review the phase implementation documents
2. Choose which phase to start with (recommend Phase 2)
3. Begin with the highest-value features
4. Implement incrementally with testing
5. Update configurations as features are added

## Success Criteria

- Phase 1 functionality remains stable
- New features provide measurable value
- Performance impact stays minimal
- User experience improves
- System remains reliable and secure
