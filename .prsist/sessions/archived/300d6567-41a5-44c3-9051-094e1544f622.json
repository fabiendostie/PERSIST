Session starts → Hook initializes memory system → Context loaded for Claude\n2. Tool usage → Hook logs interaction → Database updated → Session file updated\n3. File modifications → Tracked and hashed → Line changes calculated\n4. Periodic checkpoints → Session state preserved → Cleanup based on retention policy\n\n## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)\n\n- Semantic similarity scoring for context relevance\n- Advanced context scoring algorithms\n- Intelligent summarization of session data\n- Cross-session learning and pattern recognition\n- Integration with BMAD agent memory sharing\n- Enhanced workflow integration capabilities\n\n## Updated 2025-08-17 15:01:07\n\n✅ **Memory System Integration** completed at 2025-08-17 15:01\n   Successfully integrated Claude Code hooks with memory system for session tracking and context injection\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 17:45:17\n\n✅ **Documentation Organized** completed at 2025-08-18 17:45\n   Created clean docs folder with accurate documentation, removed fictional content, updated README with current implementation status\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 18:31:13\n\n✅ **Simple CLI Commands** completed at 2025-08-18 18:31\n   Created prsist.py with single-letter commands that can be chained together, making the memory system much easier to use\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 18:33:07\n\n✅ **Complete CLI Interface** completed at 2025-08-18 18:33\n   Added all missing commands to prsist.py including session management, data operations, project memory, decisions, export, cleanup - every possible memory operation now has a simple single-letter command that can be chained together\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 18:42:37\n\n✅ **CLI Testing Complete** completed at 2025-08-18 18:42\n   Created comprehensive test suite that validates all 28 CLI commands and command combinations with 100% success rate - every single memory operation is working perfectly",
