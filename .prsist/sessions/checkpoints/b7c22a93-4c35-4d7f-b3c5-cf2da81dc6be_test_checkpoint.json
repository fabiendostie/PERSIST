      "project_memory": "# Project Memory\n\nThis file contains persistent project context and learned information that should be preserved across Claude Code sessions.\n\n## Project Overview\n\n**Project Path:** D:\\Projects\\Dev\\Memory\n**Memory System:** Prsist Memory System v1.0\n**Created:** 2025-01-17\n\nThis project implements the Prsist System framework with an integrated Prsist Memory System for enhanced AI-powered development workflows.\n\n## Key Decisions and Patterns\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\n- **Hybrid Storage Strategy**: Combination of JSON files for session data and SQLite database for efficient querying and relationships\n- **Hook-Based Integration**: Non-invasive integration with Claude Code using hooks that fail gracefully\n- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for database, session tracking, context building, and memory management\n- **Security-First Approach**: Input sanitization, path validation, and parameterized queries throughout\n\n### Development Patterns\n\n- **Dependency Resolution System**: BMAD agents only load required resources to keep context lean\n- **Template-Based Documentation**: YAML-structured templates for consistent document generation\n- **Automated Release Strategy**: Dual publishing with beta and stable channels\n\n## Important Context\n\n### Prsist System Framework\n- Uses specialized AI agents for different development roles (architect, developer, QA, etc.)\n- Implements sophisticated dependency system for context management\n- Templates defined in YAML format with structured sections\n- Build system creates concatenated text bundles from agent definitions\n\n### Memory System Integration\n- Phase 1 focuses on core session tracking with hooks, session files, SQLite storage, and basic context injection\n- Designed to be compatible with existing BMAD workflows\n- Must not interfere with Claude Code performance (hooks complete within 2 seconds)\n- Implements automatic cleanup and retention policies\n\n### Configuration Management\n- Central configuration in `bmad-core/core-config.yaml`\n- Memory system configuration in `.prsist/config/memory-config.yaml`\n- Markdown linting rules enforced via Prettier\n- Version management for core and expansion packs\n\n## Development Notes\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- Hook execution must complete within 2 seconds\n- Memory usage should be minimal (< 50MB)\n- Database operations should be atomic\n- File I/O should be non-blocking where possible\n\n### Security Considerations\n- All file paths validated to prevent directory traversal\n- Inputs sanitized before database insertion\n- Parameterized SQL queries used throughout\n- Appropriate file permissions set on memory system files\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- Session creation and tracking validation\n- SQLite database operations verification\n- Context injection functionality testing\n- Hook execution timing validation\n- Error handling and edge case testing\n\n## Architecture Notes\n\n### Memory System Components\n\n1. **Database Layer** (`database.py`): SQLite operations for persistent storage\n2. **Session Tracker** (`session_tracker.py`): Session lifecycle management\n3. **Context Builder** (`context_builder.py`): Context injection and relevance scoring\n4. **Memory Manager** (`memory_manager.py`): Main interface for memory operations\n5. **Utilities** (`utils.py`): Common helpers and validation functions\n\n### Integration Points\n\n- **Claude Code Hooks**: `SessionStart.py` and `PostToolUse.py` in `.claude/hooks/`\n- **Configuration Files**: YAML configuration and JSON schema validation\n- **Storage Structure**: Organized directory structure under `.prsist/`\n- **BMAD Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with existing BMAD workflows\n\n### Data Flow\n\n1. Session starts → Hook initializes memory system → Context loaded for Claude\n2. Tool usage → Hook logs interaction → Database updated → Session file updated\n3. File modifications → Tracked and hashed → Line changes calculated\n4. Periodic checkpoints → Session state preserved → Cleanup based on retention policy\n\n## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)\n\n- Semantic similarity scoring for context relevance\n- Advanced context scoring algorithms\n- Intelligent summarization of session data\n- Cross-session learning and pattern recognition\n- Integration with BMAD agent memory sharing\n- Enhanced workflow integration capabilities\n\n## Updated 2025-08-17 15:01:07\n\n✅ **Memory System Integration** completed at 2025-08-17 15:01\n   Successfully integrated Claude Code hooks with memory system for session tracking and context injection\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 17:45:17\n\n✅ **Documentation Organized** completed at 2025-08-18 17:45\n   Created clean docs folder with accurate documentation, removed fictional content, updated README with current implementation status\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 18:31:13\n\n✅ **Simple CLI Commands** completed at 2025-08-18 18:31\n   Created prsist.py with single-letter commands that can be chained together, making the memory system much easier to use\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 18:33:07\n\n✅ **Complete CLI Interface** completed at 2025-08-18 18:33\n   Added all missing commands to prsist.py including session management, data operations, project memory, decisions, export, cleanup - every possible memory operation now has a simple single-letter command that can be chained together\n\n## Updated 2025-08-18 18:42:37\n\n✅ **CLI Testing Complete** completed at 2025-08-18 18:42\n   Created comprehensive test suite that validates all 28 CLI commands and command combinations with 100% success rate - every single memory operation is working perfectly\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:46:18\n\n✅ **Phase 1 Complete** completed at 2025-08-19 12:46\n   Fixed Claude Code hooks, validated performance, completed all requirements\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:46:50\n\n**Decision Made**: Fixed Claude Code hooks integration for automatic memory activation\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:49:34\n\n✅ **Memory CLI Fixed** completed at 2025-08-19 12:49\n   Created proper CLI interface that handles arguments correctly\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:49:49\n\n**Decision**: Use argument-based CLI instead of interactive prompts for better Claude Code integration\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:50:12\n\n**Decision**: Use argument-based CLI instead of interactive prompts for better Claude Code integration\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:58:59\n\n✅ **Documentation Created** completed at 2025-08-19 12:58\n   Added quick reference guide and command system\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:59:33\n\n✅ **Documentation Created** completed at 2025-08-19 12:59\n   Added quick reference guide and command system\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 12:59:47\n\n**Decision**: Create user-friendly command interface for better Claude Code integration\n\n## Updated 2025-08-19 13:23:52\n\n✅ **Slash Commands Complete** completed at 2025-08-19 13:23\n   Created 17 native Claude Code slash commands covering all memory system functionality",
